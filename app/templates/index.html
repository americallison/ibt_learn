                <p>Our mission is to create a <a href="{{ url_for('teaching_model') }}">
                    teaching model</a> that predicts and improves learning
                    outcomes. Our goal is to see children from economically challenged communities
                    afforded quality education at LITTLE or NO cost.
                    The Institute of Basic Technology also offers nonprofit educational consultancy.</p>
                <h4 class="text-uppercase text-center">Our History</h4>
                <p>Ever wondered how to objectively measure the impact of donating books, food, money,
                    etc. to a student in a socioeconomically challenged community? Is there a way to predict how such
                    student would fare prior to entering a senior high classroom? Well that is the goal of our
                    institution and hereâ€™s how we got started.
                </p>
                   <p> After more than 13 years of a devastating civil war,
                    the Liberian educational system is still struggling to emerge. For a country whose
                    population is a little over 4 million people with about 45% under the age of 15, the
                    future of the country is at stake. Although the government is striving to resuscitate the
                    educational system, a collaborative, partnership is needed to subsidize
                    the herculean task of overhauling the archaic school system.The practical steps to what
        would later become Institute of Basic Technology (IBT) were taken in
                    the summer of 2007 by my wife, Sylvia M. Bollie, and me. We both knew from the time we
                    first met that we wanted to help shape the educational system in Liberia. In the summer of
                    2007 Sylvia, then a medical student at the <a href="#">George Washington University
                       </a>, volunteered teaching
                    Biology at the <a href="#">University of Liberia
                           </a>. At the end of her five (5) week long internship, she
                    returned to the United States and successfully led a campaign to donate text books for the
                        University.</p>
                <p>In spring of 2013 we became more intentional by providing scholarship
                    to a few high school students striving
                    toward academic excellence. However, when it was widely publicized that about 25,000
                    students failed the entrance exams to the University of Liberia, we knew that our actions
                    had to exceed financial donations. Sylvia and I wanted to help address the larger issue
                    of the lagging high school educational system. We attributed this lag in no small part to
                    the more than thirteen (13) years of civil war that decimated the country and the crippling
                    poverty that ensued.</p>

                    <p>In November of 2015, we incorporated the Institute of Basic Technology and two (2) years later in
                    November of 2017 we opened the STEM labs in Liberia. We are very EXCITED about the future
                    of Science Technology Engineering and Math in Liberia!!! The Institute of Basic Technology
                    is a tax-exempt, federally recognized 501(c) (3) nonprofit organization whose main objective
                    is to provide guidance in STEM curriculum development and support to high schools serving
                    poorer communities in Liberia, West Africa.</p>
